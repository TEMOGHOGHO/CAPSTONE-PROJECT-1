## SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF TEMMYTEE RETAIL STORE

## PROJECT OVERVIEW: This data analysis project aims to generate insights into the Sales Performance of TemmyTee Retail Store over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to explore Sales data to uncover key insights such as Top-selling products, Regional performance and Monthly sales trend. The goal is to tell a compelling story by building an interactive dashboard report to gather insight and make business decisions.

## DATA SOURCE: The primary source of data is LITA Capstone dataset.xlsx.

## TOOLS: 
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analysis [download here]()
- Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying of data
- Power BI for Visualization
- GitHub for Portfolio building

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
At the initial stage of data cleaning and preparation, the following actions were performed;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Removing duplicates
4. Data cleaning and formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Some questions were answered on the data as follows;
-  What is the sales overview?
-  What are the Top-performing products?
-  What is the regional breakdown?

## Data Analysis
Calculating Total Sales:
After cleaning the data, I proceeded to calculate the total sales for each transaction by multiplying the quantity by the unit price. This step provided a more comprehensive view of total revenue.

Sales Analysis with Pivot Table:
Next, I created a Pivot Table in Excel to analyze the sales performance. This allowed me to group sales data by:

Category
Product
Region
Month 
The Pivot Table was essential for uncovering trends and gaining insights into sales patterns across different dimensions.

This provides an analysis of sales data using SQL. Each query addresses a specific aspect of the sales performance.

Total sales for each product category
SELECT product, SUM(Total_sale) AS Total_sale
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY product;
Number of sales transactions in each region
SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY region;
Highest-selling product by total sales value
SELECT TOP 1 product, SUM(Total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
Total revenue per product
SELECT product, SUM(Total_sale) AS total_revenue
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY product;
Monthly sales totals for the current year
SELECT MONTH(Orderdate) AS month,
SUM(Total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM SalesData
WHERE YEAR(Orderdate) = 2024
GROUP BY MONTH(Orderdate)
ORDER BY MONTH(Orderdate);
Top 5 customers by total purchase amount
SELECT TOP 5 customer_id, SUM(Total_sale) AS total_purchase
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_purchase DESC;
Percentage of total sales contributed by each region
SELECT region,
SUM(Total_sale) AS total_sales,
(SUM(Total_sale) / (SELECT SUM(Total_sale) FROM SalesData) * 100) AS percentage_of_total_sales
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY region;
Products with no sales in the last quarter
SELECT product 
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY product
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN Orderdate BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-08-31' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
